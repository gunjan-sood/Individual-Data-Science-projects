But, I've gone to the ""win free coins"" section, done my ""due diligence"" and I come away with no more coins than I started out with.  Really? C'mon guys! Get with the program! If it says I'm going to win coins for ""watching videos"" or ""taking a survey"", don't you think that should actually be the outcome? And, as I've said before, finishing a puzzle should earn me a coin (or two), finishing it in record time should give 10 coins, and so on.

I thought this was a great game.....I got to play for almost a full week, one puzzle a day. Until I evidently angered the ""coin gods"". 

It should cost ONE coin per puzzle and the rewards should be based on timing and puzzle levels. There should be freebies, gift coins, and each time you level up, the prize should be 10 coins.

I'll give the developers ONE WEEK to re-think this, then I'm going to DELETE!

Well, I deleted the app, then about a week later I reinstated it.   It would seem that they're trying to fix the coin problem.  We'll see....

Still too complicated for earning coins.  Before you realize it, your coins have been spent!

Sept.17. 2015
Well, someone finally got the message!  Hooray!  Much more pleasurable playing when you have more realistic, worthwhile goals ahead of you. The update(s) have improved this far more than I had hoped!  Well done!

I still love this! The problem with coins is being worked on. At least the developers are listening!

Still having a pretty good time with this. Coin problem would appear to be evening out.

I find that I'm really enjoying the daily puzzle.  However, if I miss a day or two, how about giving me the puzzle for nothing? Just asking!

Asking for a review on an average of once a week is becoming a bit tedious.....could we back it up to once every 2-3 weeks?

Asking for too many reviews....

I keep running out of coins so I go to the free coin store....I listen to the videos, take the surveys, but don't get the coins!  C'mon guys! Is it really that hard to get everything moving in the same direction at the same time?

My complaint remains about the coins. How about giving 5 coins per review? 1 coin each time a puzzle is completed. Additional coins when a puzzle is completed in record time (three stars = 10 coins and two stars = 5 coins).

Fix this and I'll give you all five stars, until then you barely even get one!!!
I'll keep playing every day!",AuB73,1,4.11.3,Daily Celebrity Crossword - Free Crossword Puzzles,11/3/16,Daily Celebrity Crosswords,I complete this crossword every day. It is a great stress reliever and keeps my brain active,Cyborg doÃ±a,5,4.11.3,Daily Celebrity Crossword - Free Crossword Puzzles,11/3/16,Too hard to accumulate coins,"I enjoy the game but it's too hard to get coins. The games take 10-12 and then rewards you with the same amount. Then you have to sign up for crap to get more or buy them and I do neither. I'll watch the video but that only gives u between 1 & 3 coins.

They should give daily reward coins like other games do, for opening the app or a better way of accumulating and gathering coins like other games do.

I don't play this one as often because of the issue with coins.",Souljarette,2,4.11.3,Daily Celebrity Crossword - Free Crossword Puzzles,11/2/16,It works,"Fun game, just don't expect anything flashy!",KpJlMc,4,4.11.3,Daily Celebrity Crossword - Free Crossword Puzzles,11/2/16,Ok but no longer lets me earn free coins,"The puzzles are good but you don't actually get one free per day because it uploads at a very weird time.

I'm not usually good at crosswords but these are really easy so I always finish. Usually complete in 12-15 minutes.
